    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    <div class="line"></div><br></br>
    <p>I am Aahna, in June 2022, TCS and the Australia Institute of Marine Science challenged students to create a digital innovation that monitors and improves the health of underwater ecosystems. Congratulations to Aahna B and Aarushi B of Ontario, Canada for creating the winning app “Eco Water.” Volunteer judges from TCS were impressed by all of the entries, but ultimately their innovation stood at the top. Eco Water's goal is to help raise awareness about water pollution near the user, and provides a multitude of features, including GPS Maps for local potable and swimmable water, a Starters Guide for fundraising, and an interactive “Notify Us” water-warning reporting system.
    According to Aahna and Aarushi, “We realize that (water pollution) is an issue that needs to be solved as soon as possible as, there are devastating consequences that may occur if not done so in the near future.”</p>
